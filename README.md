# GameHub

Welcome to GameHub, a social network that allows you to connect with other people based on similar gaming interests! This guide will walk you through the basic features of our app and give you an overview of the tools we used to build it.

##Authentication

We use Auth0 to authenticate users, using either email addresses and passwords or Google and Facebook account information. To access our secure login framework, just click the Login In/Sign Up button on our homepage. An Auth0 lock widget will appear on the screen, allowing you to sign in with an existing account or register a new account with an email address and password.
