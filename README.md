Welcome to GameHub, a social network that allows you to connect with other people based on similar gaming interests! This guide will walk you through the basic features of our app and give you an overview of the tools we used to build it.

## Getting Started

To get started, just open up the terminal, navigate to the root folder of our project, and enter the following commands (preferably in two different windows):
